 Hey there, so I've
 been thinking a lot
 about AI
 and its impact on
 our world.
 We're always bombarded
 with stories
 of how it's gonna
 revolutionize
 industries
 and replace human
 workers.
 But as a computer
 science student,
 I've had the chance
 to dig deeper
 and my perspective
 has really evolved.
 When cars were
 first invented,
 people thought
 flying cars would
 be just around the
 corner,
 but we're still
 stuck in traffic
 today.
 Similarly, when
 smartphones came
 out,
 everyone was like,
 this is going to
 change everything.
 But reality sets in
 much sooner than we
 expect.
 When a new
 technology comes
 along,
 we get caught up in
 the excitement and
 promise
 of what it can do,
 but often it doesn't
 live up to our
 expectations.
 That's why I truly
 believe AI is not
 going
 to replace us as
 programmers.
 Instead, it's going
 to augment our
 skills and
 abilities
 in ways we can't
 even imagine yet.
 The problem is that
 many students
 treat computer
 science like a
 chore,
 seeing it just as
 something they need
 to pass their
 classes or get a
 job.
 But coding should
 be about the
 journey itself,
 problem solving,
 creativity,
 sense of
 accomplishment when
 we figure something
 out.
 I didn't start with
 some grand vision
 of creating
 something massive
 and impactful.
 I began my building
 small projects
 that I actually
 cared about.
 Whether it was
 automating tasks on
 my computer
 or creating a
 simple game,
 I enjoyed the
 process of learning
 and experimenting.
 That's what I want
 to leave you with
 today.
 Find the excitement
 in coding again.
 We need to build
 projects that
 matter to us.
 Learn from our
 failures and push
 ourselves
 to be better every
 day.
 Don't just learn
 how to code.
 Learn how to
 problem solve.
 When we do that, we'll
 realize that coding
 isn't just
 about what we can
 build or achieve.
 It's about who we
 are as people.
 And when you're
 wondering whether
 AI is going
 to replace us, ask
 yourself,
 when will AI make
 my life easier or
 more interesting?
 The grind may not
 always feel
 exciting,
 but it's worth it
 in the end.
 So keep pushing
 yourself to be
 better,
 keep learning, and
 never lose sight
 of why you started
 coding in the first
 place
 for the love of it.
