1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
 Hey there, so I've

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,400
 been thinking a lot

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,120
 about AI

4
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,140
 and its impact on

5
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:04,960
 our world.

6
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,880
 We're always bombarded

7
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,480
 with stories

8
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,210
 of how it's gonna

9
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:07,910
 revolutionize

10
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,480
 industries

11
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,420
 and replace human

12
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:09,880
 workers.

13
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,950
 But as a computer

14
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,080
 science student,

15
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,990
 I've had the chance

16
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,680
 to dig deeper

17
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,760
 and my perspective

18
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,080
 has really evolved.

19
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,890
 When cars were

20
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,600
 first invented,

21
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,250
 people thought

22
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:18,950
 flying cars would

23
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,810
 be just around the

24
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,160
 corner,

25
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,260
 but we're still

26
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,410
 stuck in traffic

27
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,160
 today.

28
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,100
 Similarly, when

29
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,050
 smartphones came

30
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,280
 out,

31
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,170
 everyone was like,

32
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,410
 this is going to

33
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,720
 change everything.

34
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,000
 But reality sets in

35
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,320
 much sooner than we

36
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,040
 expect.

37
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,460
 When a new

38
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,270
 technology comes

39
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,560
 along,

40
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,490
 we get caught up in

41
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,600
 the excitement and

42
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,160
 promise

43
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,440
 of what it can do,

44
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,500
 but often it doesn't

45
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,200
 live up to our

46
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,160
 expectations.

47
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,140
 That's why I truly

48
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,630
 believe AI is not

49
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,840
 going

50
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,780
 to replace us as

51
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,760
 programmers.

52
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,940
 Instead, it's going

53
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,500
 to augment our

54
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,080
 skills and

55
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,680
 abilities

56
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,730
 in ways we can't

57
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,160
 even imagine yet.

58
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,000
 The problem is that

59
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,680
 many students

60
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,450
 treat computer

61
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,160
 science like a

62
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,480
 chore,

63
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,270
 seeing it just as

64
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,240
 something they need

65
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,010
 to pass their

66
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,920
 classes or get a

67
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,400
 job.

68
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,350
 But coding should

69
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:58,980
 be about the

70
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,840
 journey itself,

71
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,790
 problem solving,

72
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,960
 creativity,

73
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,290
 sense of

74
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,280
 accomplishment when

75
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,300
 we figure something

76
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,920
 out.

77
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,760
 I didn't start with

78
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,600
 some grand vision

79
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,300
 of creating

80
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,430
 something massive

81
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,520
 and impactful.

82
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,430
 I began my building

83
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,240
 small projects

84
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,210
 that I actually

85
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,200
 cared about.

86
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,960
 Whether it was

87
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,840
 automating tasks on

88
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,480
 my computer

89
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,280
 or creating a

90
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,200
 simple game,

91
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,870
 I enjoyed the

92
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,960
 process of learning

93
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,480
 and experimenting.

94
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,190
 That's what I want

95
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,780
 to leave you with

96
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,320
 today.

97
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,670
 Find the excitement

98
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,840
 in coding again.

99
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,680
 We need to build

100
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,460
 projects that

101
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,120
 matter to us.

102
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,840
 Learn from our

103
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
 failures and push

104
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,160
 ourselves

105
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,610
 to be better every

106
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,120
 day.

107
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,040
 Don't just learn

108
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,800
 how to code.

109
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,540
 Learn how to

110
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,680
 problem solve.

111
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,710
 When we do that, we'll

112
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,570
 realize that coding

113
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,040
 isn't just

114
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,920
 about what we can

115
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,040
 build or achieve.

116
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,110
 It's about who we

117
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,240
 are as people.

118
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,760
 And when you're

119
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,480
 wondering whether

120
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,000
 AI is going

121
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,410
 to replace us, ask

122
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,160
 yourself,

123
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,250
 when will AI make

124
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,440
 my life easier or

125
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,320
 more interesting?

126
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,230
 The grind may not

127
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,900
 always feel

128
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,400
 exciting,

129
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
 but it's worth it

130
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,920
 in the end.

131
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,850
 So keep pushing

132
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,710
 yourself to be

133
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,320
 better,

134
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,550
 keep learning, and

135
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,440
 never lose sight

136
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,410
 of why you started

137
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,330
 coding in the first

138
00:01:59,330 --> 00:01:59,680
 place

139
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,320
 for the love of it.

140
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,000
